# Some pulse programs for quick reference

Technically, these do not belong here. And they do definitely not need the .c extension in their filename.
Why are they here then?

1. The .c extension makes the colors pretty in github. This helps us find variables such as delay and pulse values quickly.
2. For some measurements, the footer is quite instructive (referencing frequency, how to split the data in TopSpin) etc.
