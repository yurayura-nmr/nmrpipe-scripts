# Carbonyl-carbon strip processing
This folder contains 3D NMR processing scripts for experiments that will visualize the carbonyl carbon as the third
dimension on top of a 1H-15N root spectrum. In ccpNmr analysis, is it is convenient to make a separate window for these
HNCO and HNcaCO spectra, so they use a separate window from the other carbons (to avoid heavy scrolling between, say, 170 ppm and 40 ppm).

Requires nmrpipe and tcsh (or csh) to be installed.
