# Alpha-carbon strip processing
This folder contains 3D NMR processing scripts for experiments that will visualize the alpha-carbon as the third
dimension on top of a 1H-15N root spectrum. In ccpNmr analysis, is it is convenient to make a separate window for these - separate from the
HNCO and HNcaCO spectra, but together with the alpha/beta/(gamma ..) visualizing spectra. This avoids heavy scrolling to the carbonyls, while
still keeping a simple arrangement of windows and facilitating overlay with CBCAcoNH and other spectra.

Requires nmrpipe and tcsh (or csh) to be installed.
