# Alpha-hydrogen strip processing
This folder contains 3D NMR processing scripts for experiments that will visualize the sidechain hydrogen atoms (through bond, i.e., excluding
NOESY -- these are in the noe folder) as the third dimension on top of a 1H-15N root spectrum.

The folder is called "ha" for simplicity, but scripts for other sidechain hydrogen resonances (gamma, delta, etc.) also go here.

Requires nmrpipe and tcsh (or csh) to be installed.
