Intensities

If comparing titration intensities, remember that protein concentration (ligand and analyte) change between measurements.

Also, many titrations will have a larger number of scans (ns) and potentially differing receiver gain (rg) between measurements. 

TITAN uses scaling of both (see bitbucket: calcScalingFactors.m).
